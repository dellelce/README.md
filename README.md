DevOps engineer with over 20 years IT experience.

On the development side I started with an Aztec C compiler on an Amiga 500 (and before that a briefly looked at the C16 with built-in 6502 Assembler) nowadays on the programming side I mostly use Python, but also Golang and exploring Rust and others.
